### WebDeveloperDark

This theme is designed to be useful, not pretty.
I measure usability based on how quickly you can determine what you're looking at.
Currently supports different styles for `php`, `html`, `css`, `js`.

- Purple: functions, classes & tags
- Yellow: variables / storage
- Green: string
- Red: reserved
