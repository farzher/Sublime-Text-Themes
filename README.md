### WebDeveloperDark

This scheme is designed to be useful, not pretty.
I measure usability based on how quickly you can determine what you're looking at. For example; comments are usually muted, but here they stand out.
Currently supports different styles for (`html`, `css`, `js`), (`php`, `asp`, `ruby`, `python`, `perl`).
