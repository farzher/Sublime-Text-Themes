#Themes

Themes are updated often and might not look exactly like the pictures.

### WebDeveloperDark

This theme is designed to be useful, not pretty.
I measure usability based on how quickly you can determine what you're looking at. For example; comments are usually muted, but here they stand out.
Currently supports different styles for (`html`, `css`, `js`), (`php`, `asp`, `ruby`, `python`, `perl`).

- Purple: functions, classes & tags
- Yellow: variables / storage
- Green: string
- Red: reserved
